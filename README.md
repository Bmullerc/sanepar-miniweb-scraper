# sanepar-miniweb-scraper
A basic web scraper-like program to help me learn python

The intent was to automate getting information from a regional water supplying company about the state of the 
local water distribution (our region was suffering from a drought and water had to be rationed at the time) and
then send the information via WhatsApp if requested.

Since the drought has ended and the water distribution normalized, the program serves no purpose anymore.
