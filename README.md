# sanepar-miniweb-scraper
A basic web scraper-like program to help me learn python

The intent was to automate getting information from a regional water supplying company about the state of the 
local water distribution (our region was suffering from a drought and water had to be rationed at the time) and
then send the information via WhatsApp if requested.
